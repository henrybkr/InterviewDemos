## About
* Completed at the request during the final interview process for Birmingham based print/digital company "Jones & Palmer" where I applied for a junior developer role
* I provided with a visual-only PDF design document (zero technical details) and some company logos
* Expected to work perfectly on Chrome. Additional points for Mozilla Firefox support
* Expected to be completed within 2 weeks

### Notes
> Logos have been replaced with similar generic "Hbkr" versions. No other changes since delivered to employer. Cannot provide original Jones & Palmer design as is considered copyrighted material.

## Current Features
* Fullscreen pages regardless of user resolution
* Mobile/tablet responsive with mobile-friendly navigation, etc
* Smooth scrolling for anchor tags (single page app)
* Managed to match the background images perfectly without being delivered assets
* Produced a modern 'parallax' effect - This wasn't obvious from the design document but felt it would suit the style
* Multiple options for navigation - Click logo to make it stick or unstick to the top of the page (Feature went unnoticed)
* JavaScript animation for the "Read More" area on the first page, producing extra interactivity
* Overflow handling for the section 1 area (Feature went unnoticed)
* Full page image slider for section 2
* A handful of minor CSS3 animation effects for improved interactivity

## Feedback Received
* Generally extremely pleased - Was completed and delivered in under 24hrs
* Parallax effect was praised as a nice addition
* Only complaint was that the second section was expected to be a slider - It was however mentioned that it wasn't clear and this would be no issue as would have direct communication with design team

## Issues
> My personal notes, not feedback from employer.
* Styling issue with section 2 on Microsoft Edge
* Fairly broken on outdated IE browsers due to lacking support from Bootstrap
