## About
* Code test from Alt Design. This is a real project for a real client although this is purely for testing purposes. Original design and assets were provided by Alt Design.

### Notes
> This project provided me with the opportunity to extend my skills. I used the upcoming beta version of Bootstrap 5, started using SASS in a real project and got a chance to work more with front end animations and mobile responvity. Ultimately I'm fairly happy with the result and excited to receive some feedback.

> Todo:
> * Cross browser testing
> * Additional scrolling animations
> * Mobile Navigation
> * Potential video feature on first carousel? Perhaps a modal.

## Current Features
* Mobile Responsivity
* A handful of carousels in different styles
* Majority of the 'slant' effects between sections and components are pure CSS/modifying svg values.
* General button/card animations on key features
* Initial launch animations that only display one time at load
* Scrolling animations (JS Observer)

## Feedback Received
* To be added

## Issues
* Very minor overflow issue for mobile users due to an absolute element. Have reduced the issue but still occuring (Scrollbar on low resolutios relating to the 'Creating Great Work' section)
* Desktop navigation works but needs improving. Using static values to shift left at the moment.
* Due to time constraints I haven't had a chance to complete the mobile nav.
